# F1 Team Orders

F1 Team orders is a game based off of the [NBA Dribble](https://dribblegame.com/) by [Taylor Stein](https://twitter.com/taylor_stein). The goal is to connect two F1 drivers through 6 or fewer mutual teammates, past and present. Two drivers are considered teammates if they have raced in at least 1 Formula 1 Grand Prix for the same constructor. Reserve/test drivers and free practice rookie stand-ins don't count unless they actually participated in the Sunday race! This repository hosts the code for the application.

F1 Team orders has Daily mode where a new driver pairing is selected each day, unlimited mode where players can generate pairings randomly at will, and visualization mode where players can explore [vis.js](https://visjs.org/) graph of the neo4j graph data base that powers the application.
